// Variables
// Variable are like a pot to store data . We can store any kind of datatype in Javascript variables .

// Declare A Variable
let name;
console.log(name); //undefined
// We just declare the variable doesn't store any data thats why this output undefined

// Assign value
let age = 20;
console.log(age); //20
// This time the variable have a value the will log 


//Naming a variables 
// There are some reserve key we can't use them . can't use space,Number as a first character. 
// We can't use (-) sign instead of use (_).
